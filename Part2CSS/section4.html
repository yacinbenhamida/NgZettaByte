    <h1>The Simple Blog</h1>
   <h4>Blog Title 1</h4>
   <p> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy
    text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
    book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s, with the release of Letraset sheet containing Loren Ipsum passages, and
    more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
